The pie chart you've provided, titled \"**Documents by subject area**,\" illustrates the percentage distribution of documents across various academic disciplines.\n\nHere's a breakdown of its contents:\n\n*   **Social Sciences** is by far the dominant category, accounting for a significant **52.8%** of all documents.\n*   Following this, **Arts and Humanities** represents the next largest portion at **15.4%**.\n*   **Psychology** makes up **10.3%** of the documents.\n*   **Business, Management** contributes **6.7%**.\n*   **Computer Science** is at **4.6%**.\n*   **Engineering** accounts for **2.6%**.\n*   **Medicine** represents **2.1%**.\n*   The categories of **Environmental Science**, **Health Professions**, and **Nursing** each contribute **1.0%** individually.\n*   Finally, an **Other** category covers the remaining **2.6%** of documents.\n\nIn summary, the chart clearly indicates that over half of the documents are concentrated in the Social Sciences, with Arts and Humanities and Psychology being the next most significant areas.
